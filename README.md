AlwaysOnTop Battery Meter

## Description

Shamelessly borrowed the concept and look of Lenovo Vantage battery meter. Created a battery meter that is setup to be always on top that shows the current battery percentage and if it is charging or not currently. This tool is helpful because it will remain visible even when in Remote Desktop sessions or full screen presentations / videos so you can always keep an eye on how much battery you have left.
